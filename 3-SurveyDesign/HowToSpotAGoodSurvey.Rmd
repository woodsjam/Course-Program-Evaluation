+ When you read a question, you know exactly what it is asking and how to interpret each response.
+ The questions are either to control for non-response bias, or to help you make a decision. Ideally, you decided on the decision criteria before the survey went out.
+ The survey was sent to a sample, not everyone. 
+ Some people are oversampled and some are undersampled.
+ You are told how many times each person was contacted before they were marked as non-responsive. This number should be much larger than two.
+ The response rate should be at least 20% and ideally more than 30%.
+ In the report, the responses are weighted and there are confidence intervals.
