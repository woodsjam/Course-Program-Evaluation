We will be working with real programs. University Institutional Review Boards (the IRB) provide oversight for investigators whose research designs and methods include human subjects. PSU’s Human Subjects Research and Responsible Conduct of Research
trainings are online courses via CITI tutorials. This certification is a required component of compliance with basic research ethics. Use the following link to access the training materials: https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=154&icat=0&ac=0&region=1
