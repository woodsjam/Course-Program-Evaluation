```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


## There are a lot of tool chains for evaluation

This is one:

+ R
+ RStudio
+ Markdown
+ Git

## Why R?

R and Python are the large data science languages.  You should probably be able to handle a little SQL, which we may also work with.

## Why RStudio?

Pretty good IDE that has a point and click interface for a lot of things.

+ Works with R and Python
+ Works with SQL
+ Markdown and \LaTeX are implied

## Why Markdown?

+ Actually Markdown and Kniter or Sweave and \LaTeX
+ Analysis code and text (comments) in same document.
+ Formating is done by computer not you doing point and click.

## Git

+ Allows shareing and version control.
+ Not optimal for text but great for code.

Lets do some git things.
